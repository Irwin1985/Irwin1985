I'm a ***Compiler and Interpreter*** lover ‚ù§ so I decided study this huge topic inspired by my goal of creating my first programming language called `Sumerian` or `Sumerio` in Spanish *(yep, I'm latin).* So far I can tell you no much about SumerioLang but it's a Dynamic typed language which syntax will be inspired on Ruby, Python, Visual Foxpro, C and Lisp.

ü§î Actually I'm current working in its syntax and I think this chunk of Sumerio code it ok for start:

```xBase
// variable declaration
var a
a = 10
var b = 5 // declaration and assignment (binding).
print(a + b)
```
